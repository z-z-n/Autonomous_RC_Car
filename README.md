# Autonomous Remote Control Car
## Background
Use obstacle recognition to avoid collision is an important driving assistance technology. Existing methods use single sensor (LiDAR/camera). They have higher complexity and more detection flaws. We plan to build an autonomous RC car that uses distance sensors like LiDAR to avoid obstacles.It also uses OpenCV models to detect lanes so that the car can keep going in lane. This multi-model methods can ensure more accurate lane recognition and collisions avoiding, which is more practical.
